# Map_Route_Planner
Implement A Star Search Algorithm to plan a route on a map and visualize the shortest path between two points.

The main code which implements the A* algorithm is in the a_star_algo.py. The helper.py file is used to create visualization and show the path determined.

The Graph which acts as the map to visualize the different points.
